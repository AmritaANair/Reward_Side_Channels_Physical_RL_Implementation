AI is everywhere. Right from the moment one wakes up to unlock their phone using Face
ID, to finding the best route for commuting to their workplace using Google Maps.
Crafting AI systems that are responsive and can effectively learn has been a long-standing
challenge, ranging from robots, which can sense and react to the world around them, to
purely software-based agents, which can interact with natural language and multimedia.
If machine intelligence is not designed to be transparent and understandable to humans,
it could make decisions that are opaque to humans and difficult to understand or reverse.
As machine intelligence rapidly becomes more powerful, the stakes associated with the AI
alignment problem only grow.
